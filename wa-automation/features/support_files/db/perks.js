Five years on, and over 1.2 million users later, we're continuing to grow our team whilst breaking new ground in the world of delivery and removals. By injecting life and colour into a once grey and dreary industry, we have proceeded to light the AnyVan flame that has literally blown away the dismal past and with open arms, welcomed a brighter future."
